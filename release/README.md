# Release Packages

This folder is generated by `release/build-release.sh` and contains three distributions (not committed to git):

- **light/** – the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS version (no build tools required).
- **full/** – the optimized React build from `crm-react`.
- **exe/** – a Nativefier Windows wrapper for the **full** build.
- Corresponding ZIP files (**light.zip**, **full.zip**) are created for quick sharing.

## How to build locally

```bash
./release/build-release.sh
```

The script will (and will create fresh outputs even if the folder starts empty):
1. Stage the vanilla assets into `release/light/`.
2. Run `npm install` + `npm run build` inside `crm-react` and stage the output to `release/full/`.
3. Wrap the **full** build as a Windows EXE using `npx nativefier` into `release/exe/`.
4. Produce `light.zip` and `full.zip` archives alongside the folders.

> Note: The build script is idempotent and cleans previous release artifacts before running.

## EXE output details

The Windows build is created via [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) and saved under `release/exe/Enterprise CRM-win32-x64/`. Launch `Enterprise CRM.exe` from that folder to run the app offline.
