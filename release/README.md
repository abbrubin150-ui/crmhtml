# Release Packages

This folder is generated by `release/build-release.sh` and contains two distributions (not committed to git):

- **light/** – the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS version (no build tools required).
- **full/** – the optimized React build from `crm-react`.
- Corresponding ZIP files (**light.zip**, **full.zip**) are created for quick sharing.

## How to build locally

```bash
./release/build-release.sh
```

The script will (and will create fresh outputs even if the folder starts empty):
1. Stage the vanilla assets into `release/light/`.
2. Run `npm install` + `npm run build` inside `crm-react` and stage the output to `release/full/`.
3. Produce `light.zip` and `full.zip` archives alongside the folders.

> Note: The build script is idempotent and cleans previous release artifacts before running.

## Creating a Windows EXE wrapper (optional)

If you need a self-contained Windows executable, you can wrap the **full** build with [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier):

```bash
npm install -g nativefier
nativefier "file://$(pwd)/release/full/index.html" \
  --name "Enterprise CRM" \
  --platform windows \
  --arch x64 \
  --out release/exe
```

This produces a portable `.exe` in `release/exe/Enterprise CRM-win32-x64/` that launches the app offline.
